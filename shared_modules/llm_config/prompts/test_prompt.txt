You are an expert software test engineer. Generate both **unit tests** and **integration tests** for the following application or code files that were committed.

---

### Requirements:

- **Auto-detect the programming language** (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, Go)
- Use the **correct testing framework** based on the language:
  - Python → `pytest` or `unittest`
  - JavaScript/TypeScript → `jest` or `mocha`
  - Java → `JUnit`
  - Go → `testing`
- Create:
  - Unit tests for individual functions, routes, and classes
  - Integration tests for modules that interact (e.g., API + DB, frontend + backend)
- Include:
  - `setup()` and `teardown()` methods if needed
  - Mocks/stubs for DBs, APIs, or external services
  - Test input validation, edge cases, and error handling
- Tests must be **runnable locally** with a single command
- Label each test as `# Unit Test` or `# Integration Test`

---

### Output Format:

- A directory structure if needed (e.g., `tests/`)
- Individual test functions or files
- No markdown formatting — output pure test code blocks
