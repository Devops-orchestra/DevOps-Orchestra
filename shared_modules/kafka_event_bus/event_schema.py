"""
event_schema.py

Defines the event schemas used in the DevOps orchestration pipeline.

Each event class represents a message structure for a specific type of interaction 
between agents in the system, such as code push notifications, test results, build 
completion, infrastructure readiness, deployment status, observability alerts, and 
rollbacks.

These schemas are built using Pydantic models and help enforce validation and 
consistency for messages exchanged over Kafka.

Modules:
- StatusEnum: Standardized status values for task outcomes.
- SeverityEnum: Levels of alert severity for observability.
- CodePushEvent: Emitted when code is pushed to a repository.
- CodeAnalysisEvent: Emitted after static code analysis is completed.
- TestResultsEvent: Emitted after test execution with validations.
- BuildReadyEvent: Emitted upon successful or failed Docker builds.
- IaCReadyEvent: Emitted after infrastructure provisioning.
- DeploymentEvent: Emitted during or after deployment operations.
- ObservabilityAlertEvent: Emitted when monitoring detects an issue.
- RollbackEvent: Emitted when a service is rolled back due to failure.

Usage:
    These event schemas are used for validating and serializing/deserializing messages 
    sent to and from Kafka topics in the DevOps orchestration system.
