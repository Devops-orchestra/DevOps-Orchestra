# DevOps-Orchestra
DevOps Orchestra: A Multi-Agent AI-Powered DevOps Automation System

## Purpose:
Automate the entire DevOps lifecycle using AI agents that collaborate like a team to handle code validation, infrastructure provisioning, testing, deployment, monitoring, and recoveryâ€”without requiring manual scripts or human intervention.

## How It Works
User pushes code to GitHub along with a devops_orchestra.yaml file that defines deployment preferences (e.g., cloud, environment, strategy).

The system's agents kick in:
1. GitOps Agent detects the push.
2. Build Agent checks for Dockerfile (generates if missing).
3. IaC Agent provisions cloud infra using Terraform (generates if missing).
4. Code Analysis Agent inspects code quality and completeness.
5. Testing Agent auto-generates and runs tests using AI.
6. Deployment Agent deploys using strategies like blue-green or canary.
7. Observability Agent monitors app health and auto-rolls back if needed.
8. ChatOps Agent communicates with users (Slack/Teams).

Agents communicate and reassign tasks among themselves via the shared event bus (Kafka).
